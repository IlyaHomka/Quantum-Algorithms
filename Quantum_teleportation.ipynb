This is accomplished by pre-sharing an entangled state between the sender (Alice) and the receiver(Bob). This entangled state allows the receiver (Bob) of the two classical bits of information to possess a qubit with the same state as the one held by the sender (Alice) [2].\n","\n","In the following example output, qubit $0$ (the Message) is set to a random state by applying $X$ and $Y$ gates. By sending two classical bits of information after qubit $0$ (the Message) and qubit $1$ (Alice's entangled qubit) are measured, the final state of qubit $2$ (Bob's entangled qubit) will be identical to the original random state of qubit $0$ (the Message). This is only possible given that an entangled state is pre-shared between Alice and Bob.\n","###REFERENCE \n","[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_teleportation\n","\n","[2] https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.70.1895\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"mZ5X5V_pfIhe"},"source":["```\n","Circuit:\n","0: -----------X^0.25---Y^0.125---@---H---M-------@---\n","                                 |       |       |\n","1: ---H---@----------------------X-------M---@---|---\n","          |                                  |   |\n","2: -------X----------------------------------X---@---\n","\n","Bloch Sphere of Message After Random X and Y Gates:\n","x:  0.2706 y:  -0.7071 z:  0.6533\n","Bloch Sphere of Qubit 2 at Final State:\n","x:  0.2706 y:  -0.7071 z:  0.6533\n","```"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"7DDpV27ndzCw","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1602500686960,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":7824,"user":{"displayName":"Ilya Khomchenko","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GibU3exOPPU8PW5mlw6ovFeDSO5Kq2PDqchegoD=s64","userId":"15790205705690135737"}},"outputId":"ddf68eb8-37bb-4a52-8ff5-87765a3d778d","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":34}},"source":["!pip install cirq --quiet"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["\u001b[K     |████████████████████████████████| 1.6MB 2.7MB/s \n","\u001b[?25h"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"RD-vfN_Je7nY","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1602500770519,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":3299,"user":{"displayName":"Ilya Khomchenko","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GibU3exOPPU8PW5mlw6ovFeDSO5Kq2PDqchegoD=s64","userId":"15790205705690135737"}}},"source":["import random\n","import numpy as np\n","import cirq"],"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"9GWhFYhrfS2p","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1602500852305,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":1100,"user":{"displayName":"Ilya Khomchenko","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GibU3exOPPU8PW5mlw6ovFeDSO5Kq2PDqchegoD=s64","userId":"15790205705690135737"}}},"source":["def make_quantum_teleportation_circuit(ranX, ranY):\n","    circuit = cirq.Circuit()\n","    msg, alice, bob = cirq.LineQubit.range(3)\n","\n","    #
